# DAS (Diseño Automatico de sistemas)

These are the practices and the final project of the subject Automatic System Design.
* **Lab1** - Combinational logic, arithmetic and access to elementary I/O devices.
* **Lab2** - Secuential logic, reading of asynchronous signals and generic modules.
* **Lab3** - Finite state machines, conditioning of clock and reset signals.
* **Lab4** - Synchronous serial communication, simulation and reading of a PS/2 keyboard.
* **Lab5** - FSM with datapath, communication with a terminal through an RS-232 bus.
* **Lab6** - PONG, Tthe first video game, data output by a VGA monitor.
* **Lab7** - Design with SRAM on-chip (Block RAM).
* **Final project** - Video game implemented with the drivers mentioned above(VGA and PS/2) and with levels loaded in a SRAM. [**Poject's gameplay**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEayljSt68) in the YouTube channel of Professor José Manuel Mendías Cuadros.
